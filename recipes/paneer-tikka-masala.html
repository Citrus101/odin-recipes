        <p>Tikka basically means anything that is marinated and then baked or grilled or fried and
            paneer tikka is a popular vegetarian tikka dish.tasty homemade version is similar to the

            <li>Add ½ tablespoon (1.5 teaspoons) lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Next add 1 tablespoon mustard oil. If you do not have mustard oil, then use a neutral tasting oil.</li>
            <li>Mix very well. Check the taste and add more seasonings if required.</li>
            <li>Add the onions, capsicum and paneer to the marinade.</li>

                paneer, onions and capsicum marinated well</li>
        </ol>

        <ul><li><h3>Assemble and Grill Paneer Tikka</h3></li></ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin to thread the veggies and paneer alternately on bamboo skewers. Before you begin to thread preheat oven at
                230 or 240 degrees Celsius or 464 degree Fahrenheit for 15 to 20 minutes. Use only the top heating element while preheating as well as grilling.
                Soak or rinse the bamboo skewers before threading. </li>
            <li>Place them on a tray lined with aluminium foil or parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Brush with some oil all over.</li>
            <li>Place the tray on the top rack and grill in the preheated oven for 7 to 10 minutes first at 230 to 240 degrees Celsius or 464 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Then remove the tray from the oven and turn the paneer tikka skewers.</li>
            <li>Again keep back on the top rack in the oven and continue to grill till the edges of paneer and veggies are golden or slightly charred for about 3 to 5 minutes.
                Do not grill for a long time as then paneer becomes hard. Since temperatures vary from oven to oven do keep a check.
                You can reduce or increase the time as required. Total grilling time will be 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove once done. Serve the paneer tikka sprinkled with some chaat masala and lemon juice. Also serve mint chutney, onion slices and lemon wedges as sides.</li>
